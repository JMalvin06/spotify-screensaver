# Spotify Screensaver
This is a simple little screensaver that displays a user's currently playing Spotify track as a bouncing square, reminiscent of the iconic DVD screensaver. Since it currently only utilizes the Spotify API to fetch current track, this screensaver will only work while you are connected to the internet. However, this allows compatibility across devices playing your music.

This is built to run on your own Spotify application since there is not a very safe way to get it to run on 
a single central app. Luckily, Spotify makes it quite easy to create your own application from their website.
