# Spotify Screensaver
This is a simple little screensaver that displays a user's currently playing spotify track as a bouncing square, reminicent to the iconic DVD screensaver. Since it currently only utilizes the Spotify API to fetch current track, this screensaver will only work while you are connected to the internet. However, this allows compatibility across devices playing your music.
